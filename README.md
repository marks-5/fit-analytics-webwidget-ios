# FitAnalytics WebWidget Integration in iOS (Objective-C)

## Overview

The WebWidget SDK allows integrating the Fit Analytics Size Advisor widget into your own iOS app.

As a first step, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the Fit Analytics web-based Size Advisor service by:
1. Reading through the Fit Analytics website and trying out a sample product - https://www.fitanalytics.com/
2. Reading through the Fit Analytics web developers guide - http://developers.fitanalytics.com/documentation

The integration method currently supported by this SDK is loading HTML/JS-based widget code in a separate UIWebView instance and establishing a communication between the host app and the embedded web widget. This SDK introduces a layer that imitates a web-based (JavaScript) integration of the Fit Analytics widget. It exports the **FitAWebWidget** class, which serves as a main widget controller. It creates and initializes the widget in a provided web view instance and exposes several methods that allow controlling the widget.

Additionally, it defines the **FITAWebWidgetHandler** interface, which allows registering various callbacks (by implementing them as interface methods). These callbacks are invoked by the widget controller during various events (e.g. when a user closes the widget, when the widget displayed a recommendation, etc.).

## Installation (using Cocoapods)

**Prerequisities:** 

XCode 7 or higher

iOS 8 or higher

**Step 1.** Make sure you already have cocoapods installed in your system. Otherwise you can follow steps in cocoapods documentation to install
https://cocoapods.org/

**Step 2.** To initialize the pod in your project use `pod init` command to create a Podfile with smart defaults.

**Step 3.** Now you can install the dependencies in your project by using `pod install` command.

**Step 4.** Make sure you always open **Xcode Workspace** instead of Xcode Project. You can do it by
using **open YourApp.xcworkspace** command in terminal.

## Integration Procedure

We're presuming a simple app with the single main ViewController class.

Import the **FitAWebWidget.h** and the **FITAWebWidgetHandler.h** header file into your **ViewController.m**
 
```objc
#import "FITAWebWidget.h"
#import â€œFITAWebWidgetHandler.h"
```

The view controller class implements the **FITAWebWidgetHandler** interface, so that the widget callback can be implemented directly on it.

```objc
@interface ViewController ()<FITAWebWidgetHandler>
```

Add a property for storing the reference to the widget.

```objc
@property (nonatomic, strong) FITAWebWidget *widget;
```

Add a property for the WebView reference. This is the UIWebView instance that will contain the load widget container page.

```objc
@property (weak, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIWebView *webView;
```

Initialize the widger controller with the UIWebView instance and assign self as the callback handler.

```objc
self.widget = [[FITAWebWidget alloc] initWithWebView:self.webView handler:self];
```

## Methods

**`- (BOOL)load`**

Begin loading the HTML widget container page.

```objc
[self.widget load];
```

&nbsp;

**`- (BOOL)create:productSerial options:NSDictionary`**

Create  and (optionally) initialize it with product serial and other options.

Create a widget instance inside the container page by passing the `productSerial` and `options`. Options can be `nil` or a dictionary of various options argument. Important supported options are listed [here](#configurable-widget-options).

This method should be called only after the **WebWidgetDidBecomeReady** callback has been called (or inside the callback) and will return a `true` when the widget was successfully created.

```objc
[self.widget create:@"example-123456" options:@{ "sizes": @[ @"S", @"XL" ] }];
```

&nbsp;

**`- (void)open`**

Show the actual widget. It may trigger loading additional resources over network, and will show the widget only after all assets have been loaded. When the opening has finished the **WebWidgetDidOpen** callback will be called on the callback handler.

```objc
[self.widget open];
```

&nbsp;

**`- (void)openWithOptions:productSerial options:NSDictionary`**

Configure the widget with new productSerial and/or options and show it. See `open` above for more details.

```objc
[self.widget open:@"example-123456" options:@{ "sizes": @[ @"S", @"XL" ] ];
```

&nbsp;

**`- (void) close`**

Close the widget and remove the widget markup. Will trigger the **webWidgetDidClose** callback when it has finished.

```objc
[self.widget close];
```

&nbsp;

**`- (void) recommend`**

Request a recommendation. The recommended size and additional details will be returned as arguments to the **WebWidgetDidRecommend** callback.

```objc
[self.widget recommend];
```

&nbsp;

**`- (void) recommendWithOptions:productSerial options:NSDictionary`**

Configure the widget with the new productSerial and/or widget options and request a recommendation. See `recommend` above for more details.

```objc
[self.widget recommend:@"example-123456" options:nil];
```

&nbsp;

**`- (void)reconfigure:productSerial options:NSDictionary`**

Configure the widget with the new productSerial and/or widget options. If the `productSerial` argument is non-nil and is different from the last provided product serial, this will trigger a request for the product information. After the new product info has been loaded, the **webWidgetDidLoadProduct** will be called. If the product serial is invalid or the product isn't supported by FitAnalytics, the **webWidgetDidFailLoadingProduct** will be called.

```objc
[self.widget reconfigure:@"example-123456" options:nil];

// OR

[self.widget reconfigure:nil options:@{ "sizes": @[ @"XL" ] ];
```

Reconfigure the widget with new product serial and/or widget options object.

## Callbacks

```objc
- (void)webWidgetDidBecomeReady:(FITAWebWidget *)widget;
```

This method will be called when widget container inside the WebView has successfully loaded and is ready to accept commands.

&nbsp;

```objc
- (void)webWidgetInitialized:(FITAWebWidget *)widget;
```

This method will be called when widget container inside the WebView has successfully loaded.

&nbsp;

```objc
- (void)webWidgetDidFailLoading:(FITAWebWidget *)widget withError:(NSError *)error;
```

This method will be called when widget inside the WebView has failed to load or initialize for some reason.

&nbsp;

```objc
- (void)webWidgetDidLoadProduct:(FITAWebWidget *)widget productId:(NSString *)productId details:(NSDictionary *)details;
```

This method will be called when widget successfully loaded the product info. It means the product is supported and the widget should be able to provide a size recommendation for it.

&nbsp;

```objc
- (void)webWidgetDidFailLoadingProduct:(FITAWebWidget *)widget productId:(NSString *)productId details:(NSDictionary *)details;
```

This method will be called when widget failed to load the product info or the product is not supported.

&nbsp;

```objc
- (void)webWidgetDidOpen:(FITAWebWidget *)widget productId:(NSString *)productId;
```

This method will be called when widget has successfully opened after the `open` method call.

## Configurable widget options

`sizes` ..  an array of available sizes for the current product

`manufacturedSizes` .. a dictionary of all manfactured sizes for the current product, including their availability status

`userId` .. the shop's user id, in case the user is logged in

`shopCountry` .. the country of the shop

`language` .. the language mutation of the shop
